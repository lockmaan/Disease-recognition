# Disease recognition

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

this is supposed to define which illness our patient is dealing with , this is only to be used as assitance to the doctors and not alone 
and possibly as part of a bigger app that helps doctors keep track of thier patients in general


## Background

facilitates the recognition of ilnesses for doctors , eliviates some of the pressur , may also be used as first contact for the patients to check on themselves 
when home as a first step
my motivation is the same reason why this topic is interesting to being with and it's because this is human life we're dealing with here so ofc it's interesting 
well another thing that motivates me on top of it is well ofc that i also wanted to create an app to help track patients for doctors no matter what , but this would be a goood addition to it



## How is it used?

You list the symptoms that the patient is going through and it tells you the illnesses the patient is likely facing. to be kept in mind is the need for a professional doctor arround 
cause no matter how reliable this ai will be it will never be replace a human recognition especially that of a professional

## Data sources and AI methods
My data will be through the using of the app itself ,so each time a doctor diagnoses a patient with xyz symptomps with A illness this will be taken into the data base
and then eventually we'll add this illness detecting AI , also petetions from doctors themselves may be used at somepoint but that i am not sure of yet


## Challenges

It does not replace an actual doctor , and it may be overfit towards the more likely illnesses over the other ones.
of course it's necessary to keep a doctor the one using this as only a helping tool , cause after all it will never detect an illness it never saw for example

## What next?

If this project ends up being successful and the patients are diagnosed well on average . we may also add a tool to give appropriate medecine to the patients 
of course to be kept in mind this is a tool that helps doctors but not replaces them
